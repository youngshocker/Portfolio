                My name is Hanz Joseph B. I'm Deleon, and I'm 19 years old. 
                <br>
                I live in 2nd Avenue Barangay 120 Caloocan City, and
                <br>
                I'm a college student at Global Reciprocal College (GRC)
                <br>
                and Iâ€™m introvert person. And I enjoy watching movies, 
                <br>
                playing video games, and watching anime and I also 
                <br>
                enjoy reading comics and anime. And lately, I've been 
                <br>
                reviewing the lessons after class, as well as doing 
                <br>
                the activities straight away, so I don't get overwhelmed.
                <br>
                and I need to study so that I don't forget what our teacher
                <br>
                taught us, as well as my programming skills, which
                <br>
                I will utilize in the future. and I will gain a great deal
                <br>
                from my selected course and I will also try harder to
                <br>
                increase my abilities and expertise. and I want to help 
                <br>
                my family get out of poverty and compensate my parents
                <br>
                for their suffering on my behalf. When I was younger,
                <br>
                I wanted to assist my family sell wrappers. and I don't
                <br>
                want my future child to go through the difficulties we did.
